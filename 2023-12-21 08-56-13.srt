1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Yeah. Anyway, there you go. I'll let you take back over.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:10,000
DIRECTOR HERSEY- All right. DIRECTOR DEWOLF- Master Day Scrum. DIRECTOR MACK PELOSI Organize that.

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:15,000
all righty

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:20,000
DIRECTOR HAMPSON- So first we have Dan with this 2-1-4-7-6

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:25,000
I think we're getting close to getting this off our plate and into stage for you.

6
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:30,000
He just sent another note to that group, Andrew.

7
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Chelsea, Amy from marketplace and said, you know, I asked him last night.

8
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:40,000
have any objections to this and cricket so far. So I sent him another note because Rob's ready to go ahead.

9
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:45,000
push this change and a few other changes and then we'll do a UAT.

10
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:50,000
in on residential probably, you know.

11
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:55,000
I don't know if they're working or what they're doing next week, and then we'll get this moved to Pratt.

12
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:00,000
So there's a few more that are like that. So when we get to those, I'll just say, yep.

13
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:05,000
part of the residential push. Okay. Easy peasy. Christy.

14
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:10,000
1-2-9-2-3-4

15
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:15,000
No new update.

16
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:20,000
All right. Same on the next one. There's no new update on that.

17
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:25,000
one. ELLIE WILSON- All righty. Dan. DAN BALZ- Yeah it's just

18
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:30,000
It's in the queue. All right. Aaron.

19
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:35,000
store true ice I know you didn't

20
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:40,000
DIRECTOR MACKAY I'll update on that. Yeah. DIRECTOR MACKAY Okay. DIRECTOR MACKAY We've not made any progress on that.

21
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:45,000
I think Lawrence was going to handle next steps for that.

22
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Undertexter av Nicolai Winther

23
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:55,000
All righty. Dan, 2023.

24
00:01:55,000 --> 00:02:00,000
penetration test. Yeah I put the update in there. Still.

25
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:05,000
three of 22 resolved and in pride um there's going to be four

26
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:10,000
changes going out and I have to confirm looks like purpose.

27
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:15,000
fix the four items that they had for international. So hopefully.

28
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:20,000
That number will drop or go to the upper number will go to.

29
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:25,000
11 in the coming weeks.

30
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:30,000
perhaps it'll go to seven as soon as today depending on if they deployed those to

31
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:35,000
i think they did that's the thing i got but i'm just gonna go check something and yeah

32
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:40,000
So moving along. Awesome.

33
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Next one, Erin, Megan.

34
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:50,000
I have the calculator up for this.

35
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:55,000
built out and looking nice. I'm working on the actual recommendations, the actual

36
00:02:55,000 --> 00:03:00,000
calculations of it.

37
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:05,000
I know I've been working on the calculator for a bit, but... Yeah, I haven't done it.

38
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:10,000
anything so would this update still be correct then built out

39
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:15,000
later outline yeah i think it's probably more than 20 but okay

40
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Do you want me just to push it to 30 or 40?

41
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:25,000
be okay with saying 30. yeah

42
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Ready?

43
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Next one we got is Dan, eStore Review and Purge.

44
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Yeah, I have the solution. They actually have something in there.

45
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:45,000
where you can have it show that your account's been disabled.

46
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:50,000
And so that way, if somebody would come back with an old account.

47
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:55,000
that's been not used for several years, they would get a message as opposed to just it.

48
00:03:55,000 --> 00:04:00,000
go with erroring out i also found out what other login statuses do so it's good exercise

49
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:05,000
I know what I need to do. And now the work to get.

50
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:10,000
the logistics to get it moved into stage, execute the script and stage, test and...

51
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:15,000
stage do the script and proud all that the logistics are going to take longer

52
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:20,000
it's going to take to fix the issue but there you go i'll get that

53
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:25,000
going when I can. We got one outstanding item on this next one.

54
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:30,000
There's been some back and forth. There's a resource that's in Azure.

55
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:35,000
that apparently nobody has access to. Shanks, Patricia, David.

56
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Andy I mean God I don't know so

57
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Apparently, apparently this.

58
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:50,000
This vaulted resource is, yeah, nobody can.

59
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:55,000
access it so we don't know if there's anything in it so that's the last thing we want to delete before we call this done

60
00:04:55,000 --> 00:05:00,000
and I don't know what the next steps are because like I just said all those people

61
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:05,000
don't have can't get into it to see what we would be deleting

62
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:10,000
So I'll look to David Alton to give me advice on that.

63
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Yeah, that's true.

64
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:20,000
That is true. I'll ask if that's what they want to do.

65
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:25,000
All right, Christy.

66
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:30,000
So we just met on this.

67
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:35,000
I noticed that you had put in this. Are you thinking we should put this on hold? I thought they're going to.

68
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:40,000
to be working on it. Now, this is the one. This is the one.

69
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:45,000
one that nor I don't know how much work

70
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Well, Aaron, what is your thought? Based on our conversation the other day, this is the one where NORSâ€¦

71
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:55,000
in those new fields and this is going to be the new parts inquiry and

72
00:05:55,000 --> 00:06:00,000
I think there's going to be a lot more to do with this because there's more.

73
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:05,000
things than just those fields that are going to need to point to E1.

74
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:10,000
If this is the same application we're talking about doing that feature flag yesterday, we have to...

75
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:15,000
make sure that the data sources are all right.

76
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:20,000
to add, I guess it's not that much, but it's not as done as nor thinks.

77
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:25,000
it is, I think. Okay, because I thought we were a little close.

78
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:30,000
closer to but I guess you're right especially we're going to piggyback off of this

79
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:35,000
ticket for the feature flag or the other ticket because the other ticket is for e1 and

80
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:40,000
I kind of thought that's what David was saying. The original part.

81
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:45,000
arts inquiry because this isn't a branch right on on in uh

82
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:50,000
source control so uh we did branch it but yeah it's going to be so

83
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:55,000
application so the other will merge application

84
00:06:55,000 --> 00:07:00,000
The other application for E1 is the one that we've got to.

85
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:05,000
focus on the feature flag for, I thought, because that we.

86
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:10,000
David wants it so it works in E1 and it works in world and we can just flip that flag.

87
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:15,000
So I was thinking that flag would be over there. Then do we want another flag?

88
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:20,000
for this one where we have the new fields present. No, no, so there's only...

89
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:25,000
one applic there isn't another application there's only one right so originally

90
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:30,000
I thought we were going to have like an E1 version and a world version, but that's not, that's not.

91
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:35,000
what Dave wants it and I guess this is how we're how we're handling it which makes sense

92
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Because when he said it has to be deployed to hundreds of machines, yeah, you don't want to.

93
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:45,000
redeploy all those MSIs all at the same time along with everything else.

94
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:50,000
So this has to be a flag in like...

95
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:55,000
the configuration that we can just update a configuration file.

96
00:07:55,000 --> 00:08:00,000
right but there's two things at play here right

97
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:05,000
There's the original parts. There's a table, Zach, saying. So, no, so we are changing.

98
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:10,000
the original parts inquiry, like we're updating that to contain all of the features.

99
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:15,000
for E1 that will be activated with a feature flag.

100
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:20,000
talk about it offline but basically there there's more to do with this one

101
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:25,000
Yeah, I mean, there's this one and there's the other ticket, Christy. So I don't know which ticket.

102
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:30,000
we want to bury this or, you know, leverage that feature.

103
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:35,000
It needs to be on this one. I think so too, because it is.

104
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:40,000
because the other one is really for CRP and we want to just put that to the side and say this is ready for.

105
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:45,000
CRP. And then this one is where we do all the real work on.

106
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:50,000
and getting it prepared. I got you. I got you. Okay.

107
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:55,000
That's fine. Yeah, then somebody can remove that comment if you want.

108
00:08:55,000 --> 00:09:00,000
I thought since we weren't deploying this for several months

109
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:05,000
to put it on hold. Since we're not going to.

110
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:10,000
deploy this until we clean the data. Well, no, I think we are going to.

111
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:15,000
I think we're, so the idea is that it's a feature flag. So we just leave the new.

112
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:20,000
fields off until we switch to E1 or we're ready to bring it in.

113
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:25,000
Or maybe we have two feature flags, one for, well, we'll talk about it, but I think the

114
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:30,000
of this is totally independent of the data cleanup effort. If I was understanding Dave correctly.

115
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:35,000
Exactly. Christy, is that what you got too?

116
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:40,000
Yeah, I think what the plan was is to hide those fields, to go ahead and have them there.

117
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:45,000
but hide them yeah until he won yeah but that way we can just turn them back on

118
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:50,000
on when we're ready. We don't have to redeploy.

119
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:55,000
And I guess it probably will have, well, who knows how long the data cleanup effort will take.

120
00:09:55,000 --> 00:10:00,000
be yeah i thought a long time personally but okay

121
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:05,000
all good yeah all righty the next one we got is for

122
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:10,000
Erin.

123
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:15,000
I kind of put this one on hold because the ice calculator was more important.

124
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:20,000
probably start this one well I started it

125
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:25,000
I'll probably come back to this either tomorrow or...

126
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:30,000
after New Year's. Okay.

127
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:35,000
All right. Oops. Our next one is Dan.

128
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:40,000
the add to residential. DIRECTOR HERSEY- Yeah that's.

129
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:45,000
going to be done next year. It's kind of interesting. I went through every ticket.

130
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:50,000
that I had open yesterday and I for some reason these weren't showing up

131
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:55,000
the two there's been two so far because i put updates on like 20 tickets yesterday

132
00:10:55,000 --> 00:11:00,000
I have that issue sometimes too. Okay. I don't know what I did wrong.

133
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:05,000
Well, here's another one, Cloudflare Enterprise.

134
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:10,000
Yeah, that's frustrating. No, no update on it.

135
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:15,000
same same update as what was in there before so you can just change the date if you want

136
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:20,000
Easy peasy. All right. Our next one is for.

137
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:25,000
Christy, Creatability for Users. Yeah, there's no update on that.

138
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:30,000
this one right now. Awesome sauce. Next one, Dan.

139
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:35,000
Yeah, we're going back and forth.

140
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:40,000
one has an accurate update we're going back and forth with shopify support and they're not getting it

141
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:45,000
So I don't know. But yeah, they need to help.

142
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:50,000
us understand what we need to do to get validated so we can get to the next step so this

143
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:55,000
Just slow going, but it is what it is.

144
00:11:55,000 --> 00:12:00,000
All right. Megan anything on this one.

145
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:05,000
no i mean it's going okay cool

146
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:10,000
Do you want to go over any of these Dan the pen test.

147
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:15,000
No, she can just buzz past.

148
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:20,000
Pentest Residential. DIRECTOR HERSEY- No I'll get those updated after.

149
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:25,000
Rob does this thing. Okay.

150
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:30,000
international ones are in here too so yeah i'll get those updated according

151
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:35,000
and probably get them moved into either in Pratt or to UH.

152
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:40,000
once we get them deployed to stage.

153
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:45,000
Okay. Anything on the e-store? Well...

154
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:50,000
Yeah, just leave it where it's at. I'm using that ticket to document the...

155
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:55,000
process for basically for customers and discounts

156
00:12:55,000 --> 00:13:00,000
since that was an issue. Anyway, it's fine.

157
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:05,000
Aaron, IT Wiki. I've not.

158
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:10,000
started on it okay catalog domains Dan

159
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:15,000
Yes, I got those all.

160
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:20,000
cataloged. I need to do a little cleanup on that.

161
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:25,000
So why, I wonder why this is, what status is this in?

162
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:30,000
You probably have it in the wrong. Yep.

163
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:35,000
So. Okay.

164
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:40,000
General software custom. Okay, I need to remember to do that because I created this just yet.

165
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:45,000
Is this marketing, technically? No, this is completely...

166
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:50,000
IT related. So I would put it under IT. Yeah. Business solutions.

167
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:55,000
Yeah. Oops. Okay. Yeah.

168
00:13:55,000 --> 00:14:00,000
the request templates too recently.

169
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:05,000
It has some information in it. Okay.

170
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:10,000
Megan mobile menu and main menu do not match.

171
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:15,000
Yeah, I fixed that. I'll close it. Okay.

172
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:20,000
And then our last one, Dan, B2B Migration Project.

173
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:25,000
yeah this is um just getting started

174
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:30,000
so I think Megan might have put this in there just uh as I did uh

175
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:35,000
placeholder for our integration so um

176
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:40,000
Aaron, you know, we'll talk more about this in the new year, but we probably.

177
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:45,000
we get together and start kind of mapping this out a little bit.

178
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:50,000
Now that we've made the decision to go with two stores.

179
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:55,000
This integration will get a little bit more. It's not that big of a deal, but a little.

180
00:14:55,000 --> 00:15:00,000
hey, got to check for two flags, and then you'll know your destination based on the.

181
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:05,000
value of the flags that are in parts of the inquiry

182
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:10,000
I guess that's the other thing, Megan. We probably.

183
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:15,000
need to either resurrect or create a new ticket that says we need another feature

184
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:20,000
flag or that future flag another flag in parts of quarry to indicate whether

185
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:25,000
the part as a B to C. And so that's just one more checkbox.

186
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:30,000
the field so it'll be a database update and then add that check box and then based on the

187
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:35,000
value of those check boxes will integrate. And then there's some research.

188
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:40,000
should do and the api and things like that so this will probably get a little momentum starting

189
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:45,000
next year but for right now Aaron you've got so many other big priorities I just stay focused.

190
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:50,000
on them. Yeah, I'll schedule something for when we come back.

191
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:55,000
But I was thinking, Dan, I don't even know if you want to add the B to C flag.

192
00:15:55,000 --> 00:16:00,000
because pricing is not correct in parts inquiry.

193
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:05,000
We can talk about that more, but. Yay. Yeah.

194
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:10,000
Because we wouldn't want to auto-upload the new part and then have the pricing be wrong.

195
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:15,000
be like uploading to draft status and then i could go in and

196
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:20,000
change it i don't know anyways i gotcha yeah let's i woke up at three

197
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:25,000
last night and all these sloshes came in my head and I wrote them down on my phone.

198
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:30,000
You're like a comedian who wakes up in the middle of the night and has the best jokes.

199
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:35,000
yeah great all right we're good but yeah i'll schedule something

200
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:40,000
for all of us to get back. Who should be involved in that? I don't want to waste.

201
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:45,000
David Alton's time, but do we need him in that discussion?

202
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:50,000
Let's just do it there. And Aaron, you're comfortable, right? And then we'll report back to David. You know, keep in mind.

203
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:55,000
update on it. That way calendars will be easier to find time on.

204
00:16:55,000 --> 00:17:00,000
are you okay with that talking about the api and stuff you're you're gonna be the

205
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:05,000
SME I think for that so we'll just keep David in the loop

206
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:10,000
loop on our decision. I think everybody, and he is an uncomfortable elite.

207
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:15,000
moving towards the SSIS route and building it.

208
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:20,000
So, and then also just an FYI, Megan, another conversation.

209
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:25,000
we had. So for new integrations, we're talking about.

210
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:30,000
and SSIS and David's comfortable with that, I think. And then the order.

211
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:35,000
stuff. I think we're going to stick with Jitterbit for now, since it's up and working.

212
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:40,000
There's no sense in building that at this point.

213
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:45,000
If we decide to move off of Jitterbent in the future, then maybe something else. But with everything that.

214
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:50,000
David Strickland has done so far to make that thing work. I'd hate to.

215
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:55,000
abandon it. But there's some...

216
00:17:55,000 --> 00:18:00,000
Fun stuff for Aaron lies ahead as far as building up integration to.

217
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:05,000
get customers and parts over so totally fine

218
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:10,000
Yippee. Alrighty.

219
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:15,000
Cool cats. I'll see you in a bit. Thank you. Bye. See y'all later. Bye.

220
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:18,026
Thank you.
