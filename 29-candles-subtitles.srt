1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Okay, here in the fire we gotta talk candlesticks. I know if you're

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:10,000
You've been trading for a while you're like, oh yeah, I'm just gonna skip over this one. Don't skip over it

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:15,000
important. And just a brief little recap. We have a high price. We have the open prices.

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:20,000
where it's gonna open, you have clothes, and you have a low price. And this right here.

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:25,000
this is where all the trades are placed. It's like, that's where all the

6
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Actions act and as you know breaking news, I actually that that's just the

7
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,000
It's green, but all my candles I change them white and gray.

8
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:40,000
want to see where's the action happening. Now on the bit corn, which I traded.

9
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:45,000
with you, which is a terrible example to use, but a great example at the same time.

10
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:50,000
I will I will show you and there's something that you don't see so I'm gonna

11
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:55,000
at it. Right here is the top, that is the tippy top of the wick.

12
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Again, I make my wicks real light. I can see them probably not good for f...

13
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:05,000
filming, that's actually the bottom. So there was so much

14
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Well, not not a lot, but enough to take out your order. Because let's see you-

15
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:15,000
take out an order here and you're like, okay, we're gonna short this thing. And then you put in a stop.

16
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Let's just say, oh, you know, let's go, let's go right there.

17
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:25,000
It gets taken out and you lose your money. If I were to measure this, let's start it.

18
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:30,000
the top and go to the bottom over here.

19
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:35,000
It's a seven over seven percent in a daily move.

20
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:40,000
And on exchanges, people know where the stops are and they're like, okay, let's

21
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:45,000
put in a lot of money and take all those out and then zinc so depending on the trade a lot of times

22
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:50,000
I don't use stops now don't listen to me, but I know with volatility and when it gets

23
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:55,000
taken out enough time, you're just like, okay, we're done. But look at the amount of...

24
00:01:55,000 --> 00:02:00,000
action. Right? Nothing. That's nothing. But look, it edits...

25
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:05,000
almost a seven and a half percent move. And sometimes now this is crypto exchanges.

26
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:10,000
You're they'll they'll be down for maintenance and you'll have your stops ready and just you come back and

27
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Everything's gone, it's just zinc, zinc. You would never think in an hour it would move 10th.

28
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:20,000
$1,000. So just be aware if you're trading crypto in futures.

29
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:25,000
volatility off the chart, so just plan accordingly. Because you-

30
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:30,000
You're gonna have a perfect setup. Let's say a falling wedge. You put your bio-

31
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:35,000
order there. And then in five minutes, it's just like zinc zinc. Then you go back and you look

32
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:40,000
your account because the following wedge plays out right it goes it goes all the way up there you're like

33
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Yeah, wait a minute. So I'm just putting that out there when it comes to-

34
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:50,000
crypto, be careful. Or when it comes to stocks that have

35
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:55,000
very little volume. Also known as penny stocks or whatever. Your trading likes.

36
00:02:55,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Spire, DIA, or the cues, there's not that kind of movement. I mean, it's not that they're...

37
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:05,000
can't be. It would just take a lot of volumes and a lot of humans and with that one I will see you in the-

38
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:05,599
next trade.
